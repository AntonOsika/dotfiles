# Commands
* `free -h` for ram usage
* `df -h` for disk usage
* `powertop` / `powerstat` to see if battery can be optimised
* `dpkg` handles installed packages. apt handles dependency chain.

## Power usage
* Don't let chrome run in background (advanced settings)
* Uninstall e.g. habitlab (30% cpu usage)
* Prefer firefox to chrome. GPU acceleration should improve battery etc (test!)

## Workflow
* Shrink dock to minimal
* Rebind key theme to something similar to emacs (ask Viktor)
* Use gnomes bindings to switch between favorite apps
* Copyq for clipboard. 
* Copyq for pasting date (although formatting needs to be fixed)
